Am                                 C 
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
  Am
Upon a ridge he rested as he went upon his way
     Am            (F/A)         (D/A)            (F/A)
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
F                         (Dm)     Am
coming through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw

      Am                                  C 
Their brands were still on fire and their hot breath he could feel
      Am
Their horns were black and shiny and their hooves were made of steel
  Am               (F/A)               (D/A)               (F/A)  
A bolt of fear went through him as they rumbled through the sky
        F                          (Dm)        Am
Then he saw the riders coming hard,     and he heard their mournful cry


CHORUS

         C             Am    (G)
Yippe-ai-ay, yippee-ai-oh
F           (Dm)    Am
Ghost riders in the sky


       Am                         C 
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
       Am
If you want to save your soul from hell, a riding on this range
     Am                (F/A)         (D/A)            (F/A) 
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
F                              (Dm)    Am
Trying to catch the devil's herd,    across these endless skies






   G                   Em
As I was goin over the cork and kerry mountains
  C                           G
I saw captain farrell and his money he was countin
                               Em
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
       C                        G
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya

      D                       C
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da

Whack for my daddy-o

Whack for my daddy-o
       G                    F Em G F Em G
Theres whiskey in the jar-o

                               Em
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
  C                           G
I took all of his money and I brought it home to molly
                             Em
She swore that shed love me, never would she leave me
        C                             G
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

[Chorus]

[Solo]
                        Em
Being drunk and weary I went to mollys chamber
C                              G
Takin my money with me and I never knew the danger
                             Em
For about six or maybe seven in walked captain farrell
          C                             G
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

[Chorus]

    G                            Em
Now some men like the fishin and some men like the fowlin
    C                       G
And some men like ta hear a cannon ball a roarin
                   Em
Me I like sleepin specially in my mollys chamber
    C                           G
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah













                               Version 1
                             Tears In Heaven
                             by Eric Clapton

Verse:
] A       E/G#    ]F#m  A] D   A      ] E     ]
Would you know my name   if I saw you in Heaven


] A       E/G#    ]F#m  A] D   A      ] E     ]
Would it be the same     if I saw you in Heaven

] F#m      ]  C#/E#   ] Em      ] F#   ]
  I must be strong     and carry on

]       Bm          ]E7sus E7      ] A   E/G# ]
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

         ] F#m  A ] D  E7sus E7]  A  ]

Would you hold my hand, if I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand, if I saw you in heaven
I'll find my way through night and day
`Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.


Bridge:
] C       G/B     ] Am              D       ]  G   D ] Em   D G ]
Time can bring you down   Time can bend your knees

] C       G/B     ] Am              D     ]  G       D   ] E    ]
Time can break your heart  Have you beggin  please beggin please

Instrumental of first two lines, then:

] F#m      ]  C#/E#   ] Em      ] F#   ]
Beyond the door, there's peace for sure
]       Bm          ]E7sus E7      ] A   E/G# ]
and I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.

         ] F#m  A ] D  E7sus E7]  A  ]

repeat 1st verse

]       Bm          ]E7sus E7      ] A   E/G# ]
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

         ] F#m  A ] D  E7sus E7]  A  ]

Fingerpick it [2 beats per pattern].  There are a couple of places where achord
only gets 1 beat -Just squeeze the chord  pluck the 4 strings  simultaneously.


Finger both the E/G# and the C#/E# chords in a open D chord shape
with the thumb wrapped around to the 6th string.  Like this:

      C#/E#                     The E/G# is the same thing played at the
  --X-X------                   4th fret
  T ] ] 1 ] 2
  -----------
  ] ] ] ] 3 ]

>Chorus:
>] F#m      ]  C#/E#   ] Em      ] F#   ]
>  I must be strong     and carry on
The Em sounds much better if you add a C# with your pinky
(2nd fret at the B string)

==========================================================

Version 2
Tears In Heaven (Eric Clapton)

Below are my attempt to reproduce the two main riffs in Tears
of Heaven off Eric Clapton's unplugged album. There is really
only one figuring which is a reach which is the A to Esus2.

     ___________
     ]_]_]_]_]_]
     ]_]_1_1_1_1
     ]_]_]_]_]_]
     2_]_]_3_]_]
     ] ] ] ] 4 ]

Play the A as a partial barre  add other three fingers to construct the Esus2.

	Fortunate son 
(J.Fogerty, Creedence Clearwater Revival)
	
G                    F
Some folks are born made to wave the flag,
C7                          G
ooh, they're red, white and blue.
G                        F
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
C7                             G
they point the cannon right at you.

G            D7           C7               G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no senator's son.
G            D7           C7               G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand,
Lord, don't they help themselves.
But when the tax man comes to the door:
"Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale."

It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no millionaire's son.
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

(break: G  Gdim  C  G)

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes,
ooh, they send you down to war.
And when you ask them: "How much should we give?"
Oh, they only answer: "More, more, more"

It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no military's son.
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

10's with the index finger. (and the two 5's later)

 C
Someone told me long ago
                                     G
There's a calm before the storm, I know
                               C 
And it's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say
                            G
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                     C  C
Shining down like water
F                G
REF.: I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain
F          G  
I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain
F        G                 C 
Coming down on a sunny day
C
2. Yesterday and days before
                                 G
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                    C
Been that way for all my time
C
'Til forever on it goes
                                  G
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
                       C   C
And it can't stop, I wonder

Ref.: I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day

Verse One: Puff Daddy
(Yeah... this right hear... goes out to everyone who has lost someone they
truly love)

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death

Chorus: Faith Evans
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the days, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Verse Two: Puff Daddy
[Puff] I miss you Big
It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in heaven smilin down (eheh)
Watchin us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin hits, stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death

Chorus:
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the days, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Faith Evans:
Somebody tell me why
One Black Morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

112 Outro:
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] Every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Is a day that I get closer
[Puff] To seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
[Puff] We miss you Big... and we won't stop
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] Cause we can't stop... that's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
[Puff] We miss you Big

Faith Evans:
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you 






CAPO 3

Am                              
There's a fire starting in my heart,
F                                                     G
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Am
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
Am
There's a fire starting in my heart,
G
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

F                       G 
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Em                      F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
F                       G
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Em              E
I can't help feeling...

Am                       C
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
F(hold)                                             G
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Am
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
                            E(ddd) G(ddd)
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

F                       G 
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Em                      F

Animal city :Shakira
Animal City
Shakira


F#m
Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers
D C#
your family got bigger when they thought you were rich

F#m
And now like maniacs they scratch your back

D C#
Even when it doesn 't itch

F#m
I want to figure it all, I want to figure it all out

D C#
I want to save you from, Save you from all that's vain

F#m D C#
Save you, from the thing s that cause us pain

F#
Cause it's an animal city, It's a cannibal world

E
So be obedient, don't argue

Bm
Some are ready to bite you

F#
It's an animal city, It's a cannibal world

E
So be obedient, don't argue

Bm
Some are ready to rip you right off

D, C#7, D, C#7
They believe you now have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star you have no right to bitch
But someday when you fail

They'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

But you're the real deal
And real is your middle name
You know sometimes I feel
We got to earn every breath we take, baby
never mind the rules we break

Cause it's an animal city...

D
With you I feel safe

C#
There's nothing to fear from us

D C#
Aw ay from the fangs, the fangs of the worl d

D
I may be a coward but you are brave

E6/9
and nothing seem s so dangerous

Cause it's an animal city...

Instant street : Deus
Instant street by Deus, the balgium based rock band
Artists: Tom Barman (vocals, guitars) and Klaas Janszoons (keyboards, violin)


G C
You're probably right, seen from your side, that I've been lucky

Em D C
but I've been meaning to crack all week.

G C
Yes I've been involved, it never resolved into anything shocking.

Em D C
Pains playing yoyo in my body as we speak.


D C D
And now I found something to look for, ...but I can't decide,

C Am F
Cause I might find that to stroll behind is better than to score

D
Just like I did before.





It wouldn't be true, not towards you, to say that I'm staying

When on every single impulse, on every other move I react.

Cause in any old creek, with changing technique, you'll see me playing.

After any old motherfucking blow I'll be back.



G Em Bm
We turned away from instant stuff

Bm F#m
our cracking codes were breaking up

A D
our words were sucked out it made them clean

G Em
And after lowness say it

Bm F#m
and after more let it be known

A D
Our codes are grown into something mean.




You're probably right, as for tonight, you're making me nervous.
What is it you want me to be thinking of?
I'll put on a movie, I'll play something groovy as a matter of service
And I'll chuckle when you smile as a matter of love.

Em D C
Cause you know it's not my style to be giving up now.

Em D
And this pain in my side, I had enough.




This time I go for Instant Street
This life's a soulless excuse for all abuse and parenthesis.
the flyspecked windows and the stinking lobbies
they'll remain all the same, all the same.


D (C#) F#m (C) Bm G (F#m)

This time I go. This time I go...

Little boys that talk too much

New Day : Celine Dion
New Day.....
by Celine Dion


Em C G D
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
C Em D
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I'd had it all
But I was waiting for you

Em C G D
Hush now I see a light in the sky
Oh it's almost blinding me
Em C G D A
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love


C G D Em
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
C G D
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
C G D Em
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
C G D Em
A new day has come


same way as above.
When it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now's there's joy
Where there was weakness I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy



Em C G D
Hush now I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of a boy

I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love x2

Huuo now
A new day

Rhythm Devine : Enrique Iglesias
Chords for Rhythm Devine.
By Enrique Iglesias


Am....................................................
From the coast of Ipanema, To the island of Capri
.........................................................G................F
All the way to KualaLumpur, I will follow you wherever you may be
Am..........................................................................
From the moment I first saw you, Knew my heart could not be free
..........................................................G................F
Have to hold you in my arms now, There can never be another for me



G..............................Dm,....................F...............C........G
All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
G............................Dm.......................F, .............C.........G
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine


Can you feel the heat of passion?, Can you taste our love`s sweet wine?
Join the dance and let it happen, Put tomorrow`s cares right out of your mind
As the music draws you closer, And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now, Where the night will take us no one can tell

All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine

Am
Gotta have this feeling forever, Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters just you and the night
Follow on the wings of desire, Now the rhythm`s taking you higher
No one can stop us from havin` it all You are my heart you are my soul

Chorus
All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine X2

Can you feel the rhythm? Can you feel the rhythm? Can you feel the rhythm? Burning, burning.

Shakira .............
Ever rememberable dancing performance in the video...
written and Composed by Shakira in 2001
Album: Laundry Service



B------------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
It's not her fault that she's so irresistible

B------------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
But all the damage she's caused is unfixable

E D B
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name

-------------------------E---------D------------F#5 (can use F# also)
But when it comes to me you don't care

F#5----------------------F#5
If I'm alive or dead, so

B------------
Objection


A---------------------G------------
I don't want to be the exception

F#----------------------------------------
To get a bit of your attention

B---------------A----------
Love is for free and

G-------------------------
I'm not your mother

F#---------------------------
But you don't even bother

B--------------------
Objection

A---------------G--------------
I'm tired of this triangle


F#---------------------------
Got dizzy dancing tango

B-------------------A-----------G-----------
I'm falling apart in your hands again

F#------------
No way

F#--------------------------------
I've got to get away


F#---------B---------F#----------B


B---------------------------A------------------- B A D C#
Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal

B----------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible

E---------------------------D-------------------------B---
But you've got to know small things also count

-----------------------E------D---------F#5----
Better put your feet on the ground

F#5--------------------------F#5----
And see what it's about, so


F#5------------------------------
I wish there was a chance for

B----------------
You and me

F#5----------------------------
I wish you could find our

B----------------
Place to be

F#5-----D---------C#--------
Away from here


This is pathetic
And sardonic
And sadistic
And psychotic
Tango is not for three
Was never meant to be
But you can try it
Rehearse it
Or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Don't you count on me boy

Numb..............


F#m D

I'm tired of being what you
want me to be

A
Feeling so faithless

E
Lost under the surface

F#m
D
I don't know what you're
expecting of me

A
Put under the pressure

E D E
Of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

F# A E D E
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

F#M............D....
I've Become so numb

......A...............
I can't feel you there

E
Become so tired

F#m
So much more aware

D
I'm becoming this

A
All I want to do

E
Is be more like me

F#m
And be less like you


F#m......................D..................
Can't you see that you're smothering me

A
Holding too tightly

E
Afraid to lose control

F#m...............................D...............
Cause everything that you thought I would be

A E D E
Has fallen apart right in front of you...
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow...


F#m A E D E
Every step that I take is another mistake to you...
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow


F#m
And every second I waste

A .................. E
Is more than I cant ak

F#m ............D....
I've Become so numb

A
I can't feel you there...
E
Become so tired

F#m
So much more aware

D
I'm becoming this

A
All I want to do...

E
Is be more like me And be less like
D
you...

E
And I know

F#m E F#m E D
I may end up failing too


But I know
You were just like me

With someone disappointed in you

Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn稚 there
He wasn稚 there again today
Oh, how I wish he壇 go away
Original track was a little popular at that time, get the top popularity after a live performance by Famous American Grunge band "Nirvana" in 1993. Kurt cobain "lead singer of Nirvana" presented it as a composition which was accepted and loved. The way of singing and compositions is always been alive for the us even after one decade of his death. Cobain you will always be remain in our heart.


....................................A....

But 'he said i was his friend
........................C...........
Which came as a surprise
.................A..............................D...................
I spoke into his eyes -" I thought you died alone..
......................C....
A long long time ago

C
Oh no, not me
........C#..................
We never lost control,

you face to face...
........................C#....................
With the man who sold the world.

...............................A...........
I laughed and shook his hand
.....................D................
Made my way to back home
.............................A...........
I searched for farm and land
.........................F.............
Years n yrs I roamed
....................C............
I gazed ll gazers there
..............................A............................D............
We walked a million hills " I must've died alone
....................C..........
A long long time ago.

C
Who knows, not me
........C#..................
I never lost control
..........C.................
Your face, to face
.........................C#....................
With the man who sold the world. 















/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

We all came out to Montreux on the

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

Lake Geneva shoreline

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

To make records with a mobile

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

We didn't have much time

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

Frank Zappa and the Mothers

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

Were at the best place around

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

But some stupid with a flare gun

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

Burned the place to the ground

 

Chorus:

/ C5 - - - / Ab5 - - - / G5 - - - / - - - - /

Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky

/ C5 - - - / Ab5 - - - /

Smoke on the water

 

Main Riff x2

 

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

They burned down the gambling house

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

It died with an awful sound

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

The funky Claude was running in and out

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

Pulling kids outa the ground

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

When it all was over

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

We had to find another place

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

But Swiss time was running out

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

It seemed that we would lose the race

 

Chorus

 

Main Riff x2

 

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

We ended up at the grand hotel

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

It was empty cold and bare

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside 

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

Making our music there

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

With a few red lights and a few old beds

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

We make a place to sweat

/ G5 - - - / - - - - /

No matter what we get out of this

/ - - F5 - / G5 - - - /

I know we値l never forget

But I need some more time..
Enjoy the rest!
And rate it best if it's the right one on your guitar and also helps you! :)
ciao!

[Verse 1]
C                   Am                            C
Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall
                   G                         C
My mind is running wild tryin hard not to fall
                        Am                           C
You told me that you love me but say I知 just a friend
                   G
my heart is broken up into pieces

        C                     G
Cos i know i値l never free my soul
                 Am                       F
it痴 trapped between true love and being alone
                   C                       G
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
               Am                               F
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

[Chorus]
C                   G
Why oh why tell me why not me
Am                  F
Why oh why we were meant to be
     C                 G
Baby i know i could be all you need
Am             F
Why oh why oh why
         C
I wanna love you
    G                       Am
if you only knew how much i love you
    F
So why not me

[Verse 2] {repeat the same chords as above!}

The day after tomorrow I値l still be around
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down
you say that we池e forever our love will never end
I致e tried to come up but it痴 drowning me to know
you値l never feel my soul
It痴 trapped between true love and being alone
when my eyes are closed the greatest story told
i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

[Chorus repeated]

C             G
You won稚 ever know
Am             F
How far we can go
C             G
You won稚 ever know
Am             F
How far we can go (go)

Why oh why tell me why not me
why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why

Why oh why tell me why not me
Why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why oh why

I wanna love you
If you only knew how much I love you
so why not me
(why not me, why not me)

[Chorus repeated]
















This is my very simplified version of Matchbox 20's "UNWELL"
It may look a bit different than some of the others because I 
transcribed it for solo acoustic guitar (many guitars were used 
in the original recording). This version's limited to 5-chords.
Feel free to use variations and extensions of these chords.

[Cadd9]All [D]Day,  [G]starin' at the [Em7]ceilin'

Limp Bizkit's Cover of The Who's Behind Blue Eyes

>>> strum down through these first couple of chords <<<

Em                     G               D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
          C          A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D
No one knows what it's like to be hated,
      C                 A
To be fated, to telling only lies
 
CHORUS
       C  D                   G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      C          D        E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free
 
Em                     G                  D
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
       C       A 
Like I do, and I blame you
Em                   G             D
No one bites back as hard on their anger
        C                A
None of my pain and woe, can show through
 
CHORUS
 
D            Bm       A        E
When my fist clenches crack it open
         Bm         G       D
Before I use it and lose my cool
       Bm    A            E
When I smile tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E
Before I laugh and act like a fool
 
And if I swallow anything evil
Stick your finger down my throat
If I shiver please give me a blanket
Keep me warm let me wear your coat
 
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, BEHIND BLUE EYES

Intro 

(1) We've got the afternoon 
You've got this room for two 
One thing I've left to do 
Discover me discovering you 

(1) One mile to every inch of 
your skin like porcelain 
One pair of candy lips 
and your bubblegum tongue 

(2) And if you want love 
we'll make it 
Swimming a deep sea 
of blankets 
take all your big plans 
and break 'em 
this is bound to be a while 

(3) Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands 
Your body is a wonderland 

(1) Something about the way the hair falls in your face 
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillow case 
You tell me where to go though I might leave to find it 
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it 

(2) You want love 
we'll make it 
Swimming a deep sea 
of blankets 
Take all your big plans 
and break 'em 
this is bound to be awhile 

(3) Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands 

(4) Damn, baby 
You frustrate me 
I know you're mine all mine all mine 
but you look so good it hurts sometimes 

Jam

(3) Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands 
Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonderland

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend


Don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

   [C9] Reminds me of childhood memories
   Where [G] everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
   [D] Now and then when I see his face
   [C9] It takes me away to that special place
   and if I [G] stay too long I'd probably break down and [D] cry

   [C9] Oh [G] oh, sweet child of [D] mine
   [C9] Oh, oh, [G] oh, sweet love of [D] mine

   [D] He's got eyes of the bluest sky
   [C9] and if they thought of rain
   I'd [G] hate to look into those eyes and [D] see an ounce of pain
   [D] His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
   [C9] where as a child I'd hide
   and [G] pray for the thunder and for the rain to [D] quietly pass me by

   [C9] Oh [G] oh sweet child of [D] mine
   [C9] Ooooo oh, oh, [G] oh sweet love of [D] mine
   [C9] Oh, oh, oh, [G] oh sweet child of [D] mine
   Hey, hey-hey [C9] Oh [G] sweet love of [D] mine

D -----------------0-(let ring for 4 beats) ----------------------------
A -2---2-------2--------------------------------------------------------
E -0---0---4------------------------------------------------------------

This is played twice, then comes the familiar complete arpeggio:

E ----------------------------------------------------------------------
B ----------------------------------------------------------------------
G ----------------------------------------------------------------------
D -----------------0---4---2---0----------------------------------------
A -2---2-------2--------------------------------------------------------
E -0---0---4------------------------------------------------------------

It seems to sound better if you mute the E string right after playing the
G# so that the G# on the E string and the B on the A string don't ring
together.  Also, with the 2 performers I saw, one played an E chord
backing while the other picked out the E7 arpeggio.

Play that arpeggio as many times as you want to lead into the song:

E      A              F#m                    A                 F#m
Pretty woman, walking down the street/Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
       D                E
Pretty woman, I don't believe you; you're not true
No one could look as good as you

       A                F#m              A                 F#m
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me/Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
       D               E
Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?

Dm            G            C             Am
Pretty woman, stop a while/Pretty woman, talk a while
Dm                               C (held for 2 measures)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Dm            G              C             Am
Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah/Pretty woman, walk my way
Dm            G                    C
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me

A            F#m            D         E
Oh, 'cause I need you; I'll treat you right
A            F#m      D      E
Come with me baby; be mine tonight

(play E7 arpeggio here a couple of times)

       A            F#m               A            F#m
Pretty woman, don't walk on by/Pretty woman, don't make me cry
       A            E (strummed until the last 'A' chord below)
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey... okay
If that's the way it must be then okay
I guess I'll go on home; it's late; there'll be tomorrow night, but wait...
What do I see?  Is she walking back to me?  Yeah, she's walking back to me...
Oh, oh,
       A (hit 2 times hard then mute completely)
Pretty Woman

  G (9 fr.)                                     C
I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice

And it don't count for much
        Am
but I'm not letting go
                                  G 
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
C
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
    Am
I figured it out
                              G       (G F# G B - bass only)
What I needed was someone to show me
Am                  Bm
You know you can't fool me
           C              G    (G F#)
I've been loving you too long
Em             Am
It started so easy
     A/C#                           C
You want to carry on (want to carry on)

Chorus:
G
Lost in love and I don't know much
       C
Was I thinking aloud

Fell out of touch
         Am
But I'm back on my feet
                      G 
Eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
C
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
  Am
I figured it out
                              G
What I needed was someone to show me


Am                  Bm
You know you can't fool me
           C             G  
I've been loving you too long
Em            Am 
It started so easy
    A/C#                            C
You want to carry on (want to carry on)


Chorus

Am                  Bm
You know you can't fool me
           C             G  
I've been loving you too long
Em            Am 
It started so easy
    A/C#                            C
You want to carry on (want to carry on)


Chorus


(G - C - Am - G   fade...)
Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love
Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love

Em)     (G)            (Dsus2)        (Asus2)       (Em)
I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
           (G)           (Dsus2)          (Asus2)         (Em)
Don't know where it goes, But it's home to me and I walk alone

(Em)(G)(Dsus2)(Asus2)



(Em)        (G)          (Dsus2)        (Asus2)         (Em)
I walk this empty street, On the Boulevard of broken dreams
            (G)          (Dsus2)        (Asus2)         (Em)
Where the city sleeps, And I'm the only one and I walk alone



(Em)(G)(Dsus2)      (Asus2)         (Em)
             I walk alone, I walk alone.
(Em)(G)(Dsus2)      (Asus2)         
             I walk alone, I walk a....


(C)  (G)      (Dsus2)            (Asus2)
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
(C)  (G)      (Dsus2)            (Asus2)
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating
(C)  (G)      (Dsus2)            (Asus2)
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
(C)   (G)   (E/D)
Till then I walk alone


(Em)  (G)   (Dsus2) (Asus2)
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ahhh-Ah 
    (Em) (G)   (Dsus2) (Asus2)
haaa-ah  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ah-Ah



(Repeat chord patterns for the rest of the song.)



I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a....

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh-Ah
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah I walk alone, I walk a....

(Repeat same rythm)

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

they might say hi and i might say hey
but you shouldn稚 worry about what they say
cos they got nothing on you baby
nothing on you baby

not not not nothing on you babe
not not nothing on you
i know you feel where i知 coming from
regardless of the things in my past that i致e done
most of it really was for the hell of the fun
on the carousel so around i spun (spun)
with no directions just tryna get some (some)
tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
this is how i lost more than i had ever won
and honestly i ended up with none

there痴 no much nonsense
it痴 on my conscience
i知 thinking baby i should get it out
and i don稚 wanna sound redundant
but i was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
(that you wanna know)
but never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
cos we don稚 wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)
and all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go, go)

beautiful girls all over the world
i could be chasing but my time would be wasted

nothing on you baby

not not not nothing on you babe

hands down there will never be another one
i been around and i never seen another one
look at your style they ain稚 really got nothing on
and you out and you ain稚 got nothing on
baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes
and you keep it real while them other stay plastic
you池e my wonder women call me mr. fantastic
stop.. now think about it

i致e been to london, i致e been to paris
even went out there to tokyo
back home down in georgia to new orleans
but you always steal the show (steal the show)
and just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)

 THE RIDE
                        by: David Allan Coe   
 
Intro: A# F C, repeated twice.

C                                    D#
I was thumbin' back from Montgomery 
D#
with a guitar on my back
F                                           C
When a stranger pulled up beside me in an antique Cadillac.
C                                     D#
Well, he was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hallow eyed
F                                               C
Its a long walk to Nashville, would you like a ride, son.
C                                    D#
He sat down in the front seat, and turned on the radio
          F                                             C 
and them sad old songs comin' outta them speakers was solid country gold.
 C                                                         D#
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale when he asked me for a light.
     F                                           C
And knew there was somethin' strange about this ride.

CHORUS:
           A#                       F                     C
He said: Mister can you make folks cry when you play and sang.
 C     
Can you pay your dues, can you moan the blues
         G
Can you bend them guitar strangs.
          A#                      F                   C
He said: Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside,
               A#                    F                        C
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you its a long hard ride.

2. 

Well, he cried just south of Nashville, and he turned that car around.
he said: (spoken) this is where you get off, boy 
cause I'm going back to Alabam'.
I stepped out of that ole Cadillac and I said Mister, many thanks.
he said you don't have to call me mister, Mister.
The whole world calls me Hank.   

repeat Chorus once or twice, depending on how you want to play it. 


Well, here is one of them DAC songs. You can post or whatever you would 
like to do with them.  I had to do this by memory, so play it and see if it
is correct.  Looking forward to a new newsletter.  Later!

I promise girl I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

(I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody)

Everyday I bring the sun around,
I sleep away the clouds.
Smile for me (Smile for me)

I would take,
Every second,
Every single time spend it like my last dime.
Step to the beat of my heart.

I don稚 need a whole lot
But for you I need I
I壇 rather give you the world
Or we can share mine!

I know I won稚 be the first one,
Given you all this attention.
Baby listen!

I just need somebody to love,
I don稚 need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

(Repeat 2)
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody,
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody.

(Somebody to loooove, somebody to looove.)

I just need somebody to love.

And you can have it all,
Anything you want.
I can bring you, give you,
The finer things yeah!

But what I really want,
I can稚 find 団ause,
Money can稚 find me.
Somebody to love.

Ohhhhh Whoaaaa

Find me somebody to love oohhh.

I need somebody to love,
I-I don稚 need to much
Just somebody to love.
Somebody to love.

I don稚 need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody,
I-I need somebody,
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody.

I need somebody,

Intro:
F#, C#, B X2

F#                       C#
I hopped off the plane at LAX
        B
With a dream and my cardigan
F#                       C#
Welcome to the land of fame access
B
Am I gonna fit in?
F#
Jumped in a cab
        C#
Here I am for the first time
F#                         C#
Looked to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
F#              B
This is all so crazy!
F#                      B
Everybody's lookin' so famous!
F#                          C#
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
F#                        C#
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
F#                                    C#
Cause when the taxi man turned on the radio
       B
And a Jay-z song was on 
       B
And a Jay-z song was on
       B
And a Jay-z song was on

              F#
So I put my hands up
           C#
They're playing my song
        B
The butterflies fly away
F#                     B
Noddin' my head like "yeah"
F#                     B
Movin' my hips like "yeah"
          F#
I put my hands up
          C#
They're playing my song
     B
Ya know I'm gonna be okay

F#, C#
Yeah!
         B             C# F#
It's a party in the U  S  A

F#                     C#
Get to the club in my taxi cab
      B
Everybody's lookin' at me now
      F#                       C#
Like who's that chick that's rockin' kicks
     B
She gotta be from outta town
F#                C#
So hard with my girls not around me
F#                     C#
It's definitely not a Nashville party
F#                     B
Cause all I see are Stilletos
F#                       B
I guess I never got the memo

F#                          C#
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
F#                        C#
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
F#                              B
Cause when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
        B
And a Britney song was on
        B
And a Britney song was on
        B
And a Britney song was on

C#                          B

C#                   B
Back to my hometown tonight
C#                    B
Somethin' stops me everytime
C#                               B

i dont know if this is exatcly what he plays but it sounds pretty much the same and is 
to build off of. enjoy...

tunning: standard

E-------------|------6----|-------------|-------------|
B--------6----|-----7--7--|--------7----|-----6----6--|
G-------6--6--|----6------|-------6--6--|----6----6---|
D------8------|-----------|----=-8------|---6----6----|
A--5/6--------|--4--------|--5/6--------|--4----5-----|

the X4X676 part can also be played as
E--------------|
B--------11----|
G------11--11--| whichever is easier
D----11--------|
A--------------|
E--9-----------|

ending of intro/verses/pre-chorus/chorus
E-----------|
B---6h7-----|
G------6----| repeat as many times as needed
D-----------|
A-----------|
E-----------|

bridge: "leave me alone..."
just play around with these two chords
E-----|--6--|
B--6--|--7--|
G--6--|--6--|
D--6--|--8--|
A--4--|--6--|
E-----|-----|
im not really sure what chord he ends the bridge on but it sounds like a D#m7 or 
you try to figure it out

that's pretty much it. just repetition of the first part with variations of how it's 
by jus adding taps and strumming. just listen to the song and try to get it as close to it 
possible. hope this helped those who wanted to learn the song...

And I'm stronger then this
 Em             C
(enough is enough)
G              
No more walkin round
    D
With my head down
Em           C
I'm so over being blue
G          D
Cryin over you
    Em             C
And I'm so sick of love songs
G           D
So tired of tears
Em           C       G              D
So done with wishing you were still here
     Em             C              G          D

Tabbed by: David C Harrison
Email: davidh / uvic.ca

Not quite 100% accurate to studio version, but sounds good when played on solo acustic.

Capo on 1st fret.

  D                                   Em
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
    A                               D    D/C#
She left before I had the chance to say,  oh
    Bm                                          Em
the words that were meant, the things that were broken
    G                A                D
But now it's far too late she's gone away.

      D  
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
         Bm
Thinking why does this hap-pen to me 
         G                          A
Why does every moment have to be so hard?

Hard to believe it

D
It's not over tonight 
                      Em
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  G
I may not make it through the night
  A                 D
I won't go home without you


    Bm                                  Em 
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
        A                             D     D/C#
And the noises that she made keep me awake, oh
    Bm                          Em  
the weight of things, re-main unspoken
      G             A               D
built up so much it crushed us everyday


Every night you cry yourself to sleep
         Bm
Thinking why does this hap-pen to me 
         G                          A
Why does every moment have to be so hard?

Hard to believe it

D
It's not over tonight 
                      Em
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  G
I may not make it through the night
  A                 D
I won't go home without you

D
It's not over tonight 
                      Em
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  G
I may not make it through the night
  A                 D
I won't go home without you

C          G                  D            A         
Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
F          C               G            A
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, 

Should not ever let you go oh oh oh oh

D
It's not over to night 
                      Em   
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  G  
I may not make it through the night 
  A                 D
I won稚 go home without you

D
It's not over to night 
                      Em   
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  G  
I may not make it through the night 
  A                 D
I won稚 go home without you

I won稚 go home without you
                    Bm
I won稚 go home without you
  G                 D
I won稚 go home without you

Eminem
Love the Way You Lie (featuring Rihanna)
album: Recovery
tabbed by ambient203

Tuning: Standard
Capo 3

x = muted strings


Most of the chord tabs for this song look good, but there's a few
alterations in the chords throughout the song I thought I'd note here.
I think the chorus is pretty much exactly the same as the verse, this is
kinda how it should look:

Em: Last few strokes should have pinky on G (high e string), right before
the quick up-down between chord changes. It's not very noticeable, but it
makes playing the song more interesting.

C: For this, you should have the pinky on G a little earlier, on the first
or second downstroke. This is more accentuated than the brief G in the Em
bar.

G: Pretty much just G, with the D on B string for the full sound.

D: This is actually Dadd11 in the chorus and verse (not intro), G with an
F# bass note (here it is, I didn't even know the name until I looked it up)

E A D G B e
2 x 0 0 3 3

Make sure you get the nice down-strokes on the bass notes before playing
full chords. And that's pretty much it. I try and avoid the high e string
until the accentuated note is played (for instance, the C chord with high G)

e|         3 D 3      3  3    |  - 3 is the G on pinky for the C chord
B|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |
G|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |  - D marks the upstroke where you should
D|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |    stop playing at the end of a verse
A| ^  ^  ^   V ^   ^  ^  ^ V  |
E| ^ *^  ^         ^          |  -  ^ = downstroke
                                 -  V = upstroke

*(occasionally there's an upstroke here, after the chorus in C chord bar)

I know that looks unnecessarily complicated, and you can probably figure
it out yourself, but I thought I'd note it out since I've never done it before.


Here's the piano bit that plays while Rihanna sings for the intro:
The stars are devoiced notes that sound better played almost inaudibly.
Make sure you have a capo on the 3rd fret!

Intro

           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,

             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,

             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,

                   (slide on D string)
I love the way you lie


Verse

                          Em
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like

C
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe

G
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

Dadd11
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

Em
High off of love, drunk from my hate,

                      C
it's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate

G
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates

Dadd11
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it, Wait!

Em
Where you going? I'm leaving you. No you ain't,

C                                                      G
Come back. We're running right back, here we go again, it's so insane


Cuz when it's going good, it's going great

Dadd11
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

Em
But when and it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed,

C
I snap "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name

G
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

Dadd11                      (abrupt stop)
I guess I don't know my own strength


Chorus

           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,

             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,

             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,

I love the way you lie

Verse 2

                  Em
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you with 'em?

    C
You meet, and neither one of you even know it hit 'em

         G
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get 'em

        Dadd11
Now you gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

                      Em
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em

                           C
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em

    G
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em

          Dadd11
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em

         Em
It's the face that's the culprit, controls you both

                   C
So they say, you'd best to go your separate ways

                                    G
Guess that they don't know ya cuz today, that was yesterday,

                              Dadd11
Yesterday is over and it's a different day, 

                                                Em
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her,

                                               C
next time you'd show restraint, you don't get another chance

                                        G
Life is no nintendo game, but you lied again


Now you get to watch her leave out the window

             Dadd11
Guess that's why they call it "window pane"


Chorus

           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,

             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,

             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,

                   Em             C
I love the way you lie

                   G              Dadd11       (abrupt stop)
I love the way you lie


Verse 3

              Em
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean

       C
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine

G
But your temper's just as bad as mine is; you're the same as me

Dadd11
When it comes to love you're just as blinded

    Em
Baby please come back, it wasn't you. Baby it was me,

     C
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

     G
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

Dadd11
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though

Em
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

C
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

G
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Dadd11
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Em
Next time? There won't be no next time

       C
I apologize, even though I know it's lies

                 G
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back. I know I'm a liar,

       Dadd11                       (abrupt stop)
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again,

Ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna

Stand there and watch me burn,

But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,

             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,

                   Em             C

                   G              Dadd11       (abrupt stop)

Animal City
Shakira


F#m
Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers
D C#
your family got bigger when they thought you were rich

F#m
And now like maniacs they scratch your back

D C#
Even when it doesn 't itch

F#m
I want to figure it all, I want to figure it all out

D C#
I want to save you from, Save you from all that's vain

F#m D C#
Save you, from the thing s that cause us pain

F#
Cause it's an animal city, It's a cannibal world

E
So be obedient, don't argue

Bm
Some are ready to bite you

F#
It's an animal city, It's a cannibal world

E
So be obedient, don't argue

Bm
Some are ready to rip you right off

D, C#7, D, C#7
They believe you now have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star you have no right to bitch
But someday when you fail

They'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

But you're the real deal
And real is your middle name
You know sometimes I feel
We got to earn every breath we take, baby
never mind the rules we break

Cause it's an animal city...

D
With you I feel safe

C#
There's nothing to fear from us

D C#
Aw ay from the fangs, the fangs of the worl d

D
I may be a coward but you are brave

E6/9
and nothing seem s so dangerous

Cause it's an animal city...

Instant street : Deus
Instant street by Deus, the balgium based rock band
Artists: Tom Barman (vocals, guitars) and Klaas Janszoons (keyboards, violin)


G C
You're probably right, seen from your side, that I've been lucky

Em D C
but I've been meaning to crack all week.

G C
Yes I've been involved, it never resolved into anything shocking.

Em D C
Pains playing yoyo in my body as we speak.


D C D
And now I found something to look for, ...but I can't decide,

C Am F
Cause I might find that to stroll behind is better than to score

D
Just like I did before.





It wouldn't be true, not towards you, to say that I'm staying

When on every single impulse, on every other move I react.

Cause in any old creek, with changing technique, you'll see me playing.

After any old motherfucking blow I'll be back.



G Em Bm
We turned away from instant stuff

Bm F#m
our cracking codes were breaking up

A D
our words were sucked out it made them clean

G Em
And after lowness say it

Bm F#m
and after more let it be known

A D
Our codes are grown into something mean.




You're probably right, as for tonight, you're making me nervous.
What is it you want me to be thinking of?
I'll put on a movie, I'll play something groovy as a matter of service
And I'll chuckle when you smile as a matter of love.

Em D C
Cause you know it's not my style to be giving up now.

Em D
And this pain in my side, I had enough.




This time I go for Instant Street
This life's a soulless excuse for all abuse and parenthesis.
the flyspecked windows and the stinking lobbies
they'll remain all the same, all the same.


D (C#) F#m (C) Bm G (F#m)

This time I go. This time I go...

New Day : Celine Dion
New Day.....
by Celine Dion


Em C G D
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
C Em D
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I'd had it all
But I was waiting for you

Em C G D
Hush now I see a light in the sky
Oh it's almost blinding me
Em C G D A
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love


C G D Em
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
C G D
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
C G D Em
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
C G D Em
A new day has come


same way as above.
When it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now's there's joy
Where there was weakness I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy



Em C G D
Hush now I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of a boy

I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love x2

Huuo now
A new day

Rhythm Devine : Enrique Iglesias
Chords for Rhythm Devine.
By Enrique Iglesias


Am....................................................
From the coast of Ipanema, To the island of Capri
.........................................................G................F
All the way to KualaLumpur, I will follow you wherever you may be
Am..........................................................................
From the moment I first saw you, Knew my heart could not be free
..........................................................G................F
Have to hold you in my arms now, There can never be another for me



G..............................Dm,....................F...............C........G
All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
G............................Dm.......................F, .............C.........G
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine


Can you feel the heat of passion?, Can you taste our love`s sweet wine?
Join the dance and let it happen, Put tomorrow`s cares right out of your mind
As the music draws you closer, And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now, Where the night will take us no one can tell

All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine

Am
Gotta have this feeling forever, Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters just you and the night
Follow on the wings of desire, Now the rhythm`s taking you higher
No one can stop us from havin` it all You are my heart you are my soul

Chorus
All I need is the rhythm divine, Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes, Viva la musica, say you`ll be mine X2

Can you feel the rhythm? Can you feel the rhythm? Can you feel the rhythm? Burning, burning.

Objection tango Shakira Chords
Shakira .............
Ever rememberable dancing performance in the video...
written and Composed by Shakira in 2001
Album: Laundry Service



B------------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
It's not her fault that she's so irresistible

B------------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
But all the damage she's caused is unfixable

E D B
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name

-------------------------E---------D------------F#5 (can use F# also)
But when it comes to me you don't care

F#5----------------------F#5
If I'm alive or dead, so

B------------
Objection


A---------------------G------------
I don't want to be the exception

F#----------------------------------------
To get a bit of your attention

B---------------A----------
Love is for free and

G-------------------------
I'm not your mother

F#---------------------------
But you don't even bother

B--------------------
Objection

A---------------G--------------
I'm tired of this triangle


F#---------------------------
Got dizzy dancing tango

B-------------------A-----------G-----------
I'm falling apart in your hands again

F#------------
No way

F#--------------------------------
I've got to get away


F#---------B---------F#----------B


B---------------------------A------------------- B A D C#
Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal

B----------------------------A----------------------- B A D C#
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible

E---------------------------D-------------------------B---
But you've got to know small things also count

-----------------------E------D---------F#5----
Better put your feet on the ground

F#5--------------------------F#5----
And see what it's about, so


F#5------------------------------
I wish there was a chance for

B----------------
You and me

F#5----------------------------
I wish you could find our

B----------------
Place to be

F#5-----D---------C#--------
Away from here


This is pathetic
And sardonic
And sadistic
And psychotic
Tango is not for three
Was never meant to be
But you can try it
Rehearse it
Or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Don't you count on me boy

Numb..............


F#m D

I'm tired of being what you
want me to be

A
Feeling so faithless

E
Lost under the surface

F#m
D
I don't know what you're
expecting of me

A
Put under the pressure

E D E
Of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

F# A E D E
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

F#M............D....
I've Become so numb

......A...............
I can't feel you there

E
Become so tired

F#m
So much more aware

D
I'm becoming this

A
All I want to do

E
Is be more like me

F#m
And be less like you


F#m......................D..................
Can't you see that you're smothering me

A
Holding too tightly

E
Afraid to lose control

F#m...............................D...............
Cause everything that you thought I would be

A E D E
Has fallen apart right in front of you...
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow...


F#m A E D E
Every step that I take is another mistake to you...
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow


F#m
And every second I waste

A .................. E
Is more than I cant ak

F#m ............D....
I've Become so numb

A
I can't feel you there...
E
Become so tired

F#m
So much more aware

D
I'm becoming this

A
All I want to do...

E
Is be more like me And be less like
D
you...

E
And I know

F#m E F#m E D
I may end up failing too


But I know
You were just like me

With someone disappointed in you

Do you know what's worth fighting for,
Dm        A#        F      C
When it's not worth dying for?

And you feel yourself suffocating?

And you look for a place to hide?

Did someone break your heart inside?

When you're at the end of the road
Dm      A#       F        C
And you lost all sense of control
Dm        A#           F           C
And your thoughts have taken their toll
A#                                       C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Dm   A#             F      C
Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm      A#       F       C
And the hangover doesn't pass

Nothing's ever built to last

You're in ruins.

Dm      A#     F            C
Did you try to live on your own
Dm       A#               F        A
When you burned down the house and home?
Dm      A#         F           A
Did you stand too close to the fire?
A#m                          C
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

Beautiful girls all over the world
Cm
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
                    Dm
They got nothing on you baby
           F
Nothing on you baby
               Eb
They might say hi and I might say hey
                  Cm
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
                          Dm
Cause they got nothing on you baby
           F
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
I know you feel where i'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that i've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none

There's no much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
(that you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
Cos we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Hands down there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Look at your style they ain't really got nothing on
And you out and you ain't got nothing on
Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my wonder women call me mr. fantastic
Stop.. now think about it

I've been to london, i've been to paris
Even went out there to tokyo
Back home down in georgia to new orleans
But you always still to show (still to show)
And just like that girl you got me fro (got me fro)
Like a nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know)

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Everywhere I go i'm always hearing your name (name, name)
And no matter where i'm at girl you make me wanna sing (sing)
Weather a bus or a plane or a car or a train
No other girls in my brain and you the one to blame

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cos they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Not not not nothing on you babe
Not not nothing on you
Yeah and that's just how we do it
And i'ma let this ride

Bm            B                 G
Cause the possibility that you would ever
                   Bm
Feel the same way about me
B                            G
It痴 just too much .. just too much

Pre-Chorus

Bm
Why do I keep running from the truth
G
All I ever think about is you
Bm                                            G
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized, and I just got to know

Verse 2:

Spending time girl, are we just friends

The chord progression is fairly easy. I like to use a barred A-chord because it
makes a better sound with the song. This is my first tab and from just listening
to the song a couple times. I'm pretty sure I'm the first person to tab this song
too, so that's pretty cool.

Intro (Bruno Mars):
A                        C#m
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
F#m                           E
Buy all of the things I never had
A                          C#m
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
F#m                           E
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
    F#m          E            A
Oh, every time I close my eyes
  F#m            E             A
I see my name in shining lights
F#m         E          A
A different city every night
C#m  F#m  Bm
Oh   I-I  swear,
                    C#m
The world better prepare
                         A
For when I'm a billionaire

Verse 1 and 2 follow the same progression as the beginning A-C#m-F#m-E

3rd chorus is normal, but the 2nd chorus starts at "Oh every time I close my eyes..." 
has a little extra at the end of it where it just repeats billionaire. That little part is 
A-E

The end is just A-C#m

If you listen to the song, you'll get the idea of the strumming. Its reggae-esque and a 
catchy song. Hope this helps everyone!
